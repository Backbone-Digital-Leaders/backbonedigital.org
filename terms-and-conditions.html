            <p>THIS CLIENT SERVICES AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made between Backbone LLC, a North Carolina Limited Liability Company (“Consultant”) and its clients (“Client”) — each a “Party,” together the “Parties”).</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, Client desires to appoint Consultant as its exclusive provider of digital services. WHEREAS, Consultant desires to accept such appointment and to provide Client such services as Client requires; and WHEREAS, Client and Consultant desire to set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Consultant shall provide to Client and Client shall acquire from Consultant, such services.</p>
            <p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, and the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the Parties hereto agree as follows:</p>
            <p><h2 class="size-h4">1. SERVICES</h2> (a) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant shall perform the Services (as defined in Schedule A) as set forth in one or more statements of work or insertion orders (each a “Statement of Work”), attached hereto as Schedule A and hereby incorporated by reference. In purchasing materials or services for Client pursuant to a Statement of Work, Consultant may act as Client’s agent. During the term of a Statement of Work, Client agrees that Consultant shall be its agent of record and exclusive provider of the type of services set forth on such Statement of Work. Either Party may request changes to the Statement of Work at any time. Changes must be requested in writing with sufficient detail to enable the other Party to assess the impact of the requested change on the cost, timing, or any other aspect of the Statement of Work. Until a change is mutually agreed in writing, the latest agreed terms will apply. Any change to the Statement of Work will only be effective upon written agreement of the parties and payment of any Fees, if required. For Clarity, Consultant will not begin performance on a new or amended statement of work until mutually agreed in writing by both Parties, as evidenced by a separately signed writing and until Consultant receives any fees agreed upon in said writing.</p>
            <p>(b) Client acknowledges that the rendering of the Services will require the good faith cooperation of Client. Therefore, Client agrees to provide all information reasonably requested by Consultant in order for Consultant to effectively and efficiently perform the Services, to timely respond to inquiries, and to promptly review any materials. Consultant reserves the right to reasonably extend the delivery schedule and/or assess reasonable additional charges to the extent required because of Client’s failure to cooperate as set forth herein. Client shall be responsible for all materials and information provided by, on behalf of or approved by, Client for use in connection with the Services, including but not limited to, all rights to use such materials, their accuracy and completeness, and information regarding its products, services, industry, and competitors. Client shall review all materials prepared by Consultant under this Agreement to confirm that descriptions and representations, direct or implied, with respect to Client’s organization, products, services, industry, and competitors are accurate and supportable. Consultant may rely upon all decisions and approvals from Client, and Consultant shall not be liable for any matter as a result of following Client’s specific instructions. Further, Client may, in writing, waive the right to approve any of the materials, but shall still be liable for the contents of said materials so long as they are provided for in any written waiver of approval provided by Client in writing.</p>
            <p><h2 class="size-h4">2. FEES</h2></p>
            <p>(a) In exchange for the Services set forth in Schedule A, Client shall pay Consultant each payment as outlined in Schedule A:</p>
            <p>(b) Consultant shall submit to Client an invoice for all fees and appropriate out-of-pocket expenses, either pre-paid or reimbursed, for Services in accordance with the Statement of Work and/or as provided in this Section 2. Each invoice will include a breakdown of the work performed and amounts being invoiced to the Client. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all invoices are payable within five (5) days from the date of an invoice. If any amount contained in an invoice is disputed by Client, Client shall, in writing, clearly identify the amount of the invoice disputed within five days of receipt and the reasons therefore and shall pay the undisputed balance of the invoice in accordance with the terms hereof. Client waives any disputes not raised within such five-day period. Consultant may charge Client interest at the rate of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum amount permissible by law on all amounts not paid by Client by the due date. Client shall be responsible for all costs of collection, including attorney’s fees and expenses, in pursuing overdue amounts under this Agreement. Consultant shall submit all Client invoices to the address on file.</p>
            <p>Invoices may be sent via email or Standard U.S. mail, at Consultant’s sole discretion and expense, and shall be considered received upon delivery by Consultant to the foregoing address not receipt by Client.</p>
            <p>(c) Unless Consultant otherwise agrees in writing to front any service, labor, material, and/or third party costs, Client shall pay Consultant in advance for all out-of-pocket expenses pre-approved by Client in writing or authorized by this Agreement. Any such out-of-pocket expenses that must be paid upfront will be requested by Consultant in writing and/or by way of invoice.</p>
            <p>(d) Client shall pay for all sales, use, value added, excise, withholding, and other similar taxes required to be paid by law with respect to the Services and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, excluding taxes based upon Consultant’s income. In the event that Client is required by law to withhold any such taxes from any payments due hereunder, Client shall increase the gross amount of the payments to ensure that Consultant receives and retains the full amount of the compensation set forth on the Statement of Work.</p>
            <p><h2 class="size-h4">3. TERM AND TERMINATION</h2></p>
            <p>(a) This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue as described in Schedule A (“Term”), unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Section 3. Following the initial Term, this Agreement may be renewed upon mutual written agreement of the Parties.</p>
            <p>(b) During the Term, this Agreement or any Statement of Work may not be terminated without cause by either Party.</p>
            <p>(c) Either Party may suspend performance of the Services or terminate this Agreement or any Statement of Work if the other Party is in material breach thereof and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice. Further, Consultant may suspend performance of the Services or terminate this Agreement or any Statement of Work within ten (10) days in the event of a failure to pay the Monthly Fee and any fees or expenses when due. Notice of payment shall be delivered by way of the monthly invoice submitted to Client. No additional notice of payment or late payment will be required for Consultant to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 3(c).</p>
            <p>(d) Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant will, at the request of Client, exercise commercially reasonable efforts to assign and/or return any of Client’s personal and/or professional effects to Client’s assignee or designee. In the case of the assignment of any such commitment or contract, Consultant shall be released from any liability in connection with such assignment.</p>
            <p>(e) Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, except for termination as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Client, Consultant shall remain available, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date of termination or expiration, to provide reasonably requested information to Client and/or an alternative digital marketing Consultant, provided that Client has paid Consultant all amounts due and outstanding upon termination or expiration.</p>
            <p>(f) Regardless of any termination or expiration of this Agreement, Client shall honor and complete all commitments and contracts, including without limitation the payment of all committed media expenditures, applicable fees, expenses, materials, and services obtained from third parties entered into by Consultant, as authorized by Client, prior to the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, for and on behalf of Client, regardless of whether such commitments or contracts are required to be performed before or after the date of such expiration or termination.</p>

            <p><h2 class="size-h4">10. GENERAL</h2></p>
            <p><h3 class="size-h5">Independent contractors.</h3> Each Party to this Agreement is an independent contractor in relation to the other Party with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall be deemed to establish a partnership, joint venture, association or employment relationship between the Parties. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement or otherwise approved in writing by a Party in advance, neither Party may bind the other Party to any commitments or obligations. Each Party shall ensure the timely disposition of all of its respective employee matters in connection with their organization, including but not limited to, employee benefits, insurance, withholdings, taxes and similarly related employee-related matters.</p>
            <p><h3 class="size-h5">Non-solicit.</h3> Each Party acknowledges that the other Party’s employees are a valuable asset of such Party. Accordingly, each Party agrees that during this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, such Party shall not, directly or indirectly, knowingly recruit or solicit, or employ, engage as a consultant, or otherwise retain, any of the other Party’s employees who were involved in the performance of the Services, unless express approval to do so is requested in writing and such approval is granted. Each party agrees that the other Party’s remedy at law for a breach of this section shall be inadequate and therefore the non-breaching party shall be entitled to injunctive relief for such breach, without proof of irreparable injury and without posting bond, in addition to any other right or remedy it may have.</p>
            <p><h3 class="size-h5">Survival.</h3> The provisions that by nature should survive termination of this Agreement as well as any accrued payment obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement regardless of the reason or reasons therefore.</p>
            <p><h3 class="size-h5">Assignment.</h3> This Agreement shall not be assignable by either Party without express written approval of the assignment by the non-assigning Party. Consultant may subcontract the performance of Services herein, provided that, it shall remain liable for the acts or omissions of such subcontractors. Execution; Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and signed by both Parties in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same document. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Further, any digital signature applied to this document by way of DocuSign or some other digital signature platform that provides verification and/or authentication of signature shall be considered an original signature and have the same force and effect as an original signature.</p>
            <p><h3 class="size-h5">Miscellaneous.</h3> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid or inoperative, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect and the invalid portion of any provision shall be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy such invalidity while retaining the original intent of the Parties. The failure of either Party to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of either Party of any breach, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term of this Agreement. The remedies under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not alternative and the election of one remedy for a breach shall not preclude pursuit of other remedies unless expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement.</p>
            <p><h3 class="size-h5">Notice.</h3> All notices, statements and/or formal communications to be delivered to either Party pursuant to the Agreement and this Section 10(g) shall be delivered to the Parties at their respective addresses.  Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, all notices will be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested; facsimile, the receipt of which is confirmed by confirmation document; email, confirmed by email receipt confirmation notice; or nationally recognized overnight delivery service that provides evidence of delivery, and will be deemed to have been given at the time they are sent.</p>
            <p><h3 class="size-h5">Force Majeure.</h3> Except for fees due hereunder, neither party shall be in breach of this Agreement or responsible for damages caused by delay or failure to perform, in full or in part, its obligations hereunder, provided that there is due diligence in attempted performance under the circumstances and that such delay or failure is due to circumstances substantially beyond the control of the party to be charged, including act of God, failure of telecommunications systems, strikes, government sanctioned embargo, act of war or terrorism, act of any public authority or sovereign government, civil disorder, delay or destruction caused by public carrier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the unaffected party may terminate this Agreement if the force majeure event is not remedied within sixty (60) days. Choice of Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina and each party submits to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts located in Wake County, North Carolina.</p>
            <p><h3 class="size-h5">Entire Agreement.</h3> This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between the parties on this subject matter contained herein and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements between the parties concerning this subject matter. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be made except by a writing signed by both parties. Any terms or conditions on a Client purchase order or similar document are void and have no legal effect.</p>
